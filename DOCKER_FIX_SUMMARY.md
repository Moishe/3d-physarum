# Docker Import Fix Summary

## Issue
The Docker build was experiencing intermittent `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'physarum_core.output'` errors when running simulations. The error occurred when the `physarum_core` package tried to import its submodules.

## Root Cause
The physarum_core files were being copied with restrictive permissions (600 for files, 700 for directories) which could cause Python import issues in certain contexts, particularly when running as different users or under load.

## Fix Applied
Added permission correction step in the Dockerfile after copying physarum_core files:

```dockerfile
# Fix permissions on physarum_core files to ensure they're readable
RUN chmod -R 755 ./physarum-core/physarum_core/ && \
    find ./physarum-core/physarum_core/ -type f -name "*.py" -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

This ensures:
- Directories have 755 permissions (readable/executable by all)
- Python files have 644 permissions (readable by all)

## Testing
A comprehensive test suite was created in `test_docker_deployment.py` that verifies:

1. **Import Tests**: All physarum_core submodules can be imported successfully
2. **Permission Tests**: File permissions are set correctly
3. **Simulation Execution**: End-to-end simulation functionality works

### Running the Test
```bash
python3 test_docker_deployment.py
```

Expected output should show all tests passing:
```
ðŸŽ‰ ALL TESTS PASSED - Docker deployment is working correctly!
```

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile`: Added permission fix step
- `test_docker_deployment.py`: Comprehensive test suite (new)
- `test_docker_physarum_import.py`: Basic import test (new)

## Prevention
The test suite should be run after any Docker build changes to ensure the import issue doesn't regress. The permission fix is now part of the standard Docker build process.
